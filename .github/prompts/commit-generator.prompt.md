Please analyze the Git changes and generate a clear and detailed commit message following these guidelines:

- Use the conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Begin with one of these types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Use present tense imperative mood (e.g. "add" not "added")
- Include relevant ticket/issue numbers if applicable
- Follow with an optional detailed description if needed, wrapped at 72 characters

Examples:
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 login flow
fix(api): resolve null pointer in user service
docs(readme): update deployment instructions

Please provide the staged changes or code diff to generate an appropriate commit message.
